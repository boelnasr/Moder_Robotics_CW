"""This program determines if an assembly of bodies in frictional contact will remain standing. If the assembly stands
the program will return the magnitude of the contact force on each edge of each friction cone.

To use two files are needed. 
Firstly, a body file containing the information in about each body with the following columns:
mass, x coordinate of cg, y coordinate of cg
Secondly a contacts file containing information about the contacts between each body should be included. It should 
have the following columns:
contact x coordinate, contact y coordinate, coefficient of friction, first body number, second body number, contact normal
direction relative to the first body in radians.
Note, the ground should be assigned the body number "0"

Example usage: 

Input filename including the extension for the body data file:
standing assembly bodies.csv
Input filename including the extension for the contact data file:
standing assembly contacts.csv
Assembly stands
